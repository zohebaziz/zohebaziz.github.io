## About Animator
Animator was a partner project for my Object Oriented Design course. I worked
with my friend Matt Blanco and we created Animator using the Model-View-Controller
design pattern. The way Animator works is it accepts either a .txt or .svg file
as input and outputs an Visual representation of the given file.
## Features
Animator can read in .txt or .svg files. Animator offers the capability to either
display the files visually or convert .txt to .svg and vice versa. The .svg files
that are converted from .txt files can be run in a browser as shown in the
"Examples + Source Code" section of this post. The Visual representation offers
a controller through on screen buttons. The functionality of Animator can be
modified through the use of command line arguments.
## Creation
Animator was created over the course of about a month and a half starting on
November 2th and ending mid December. Animator begun with a basic model that could
create, move and delete shapes and output all of the actions onto a text log. We
then implemented the capability to produce a visual view by incorporating the JAVA
Swing library and a linear interpolation formula to make the produced animations
smooth. We also here implemented the feature in which Animator can convert .txt files
that it is passed or produces to .svg files that can be written and run on a browser.
Finally we added a visual controller that allows the user to interact with the
animation and basic pause, play, change speed, restart etc. functionality.
## Examples + Source Code
A feature of Animator is the capability to accept and produce .svg files from
the .txt files it runs on. An example would be when [this](/assets/hanoi.txt)
.txt file (click the
"this" to download and preview the text file). Animator produces the .svg file
that can be downloaded [here](/assets/hanoi.svg).
To try it out yourself, download the svg file,
navigate to the directory where it saved and open with chrome or any other browser!
