## About Animator
Animator was a partner project for my Object Oriented Design course. I worked
with my friend Matt Blanco and we created Animator using the Model-View-Controller
design pattern. The way Animator works is it accepts either a .txt or .svg file
as input and outputs an Visual representation of the given file.
## Features
Animator can read in .txt or .svg files. Animator offers the capability to either
display the files visually or convert .txt to .svg and vice versa. The .svg files
that are converted from .txt files can be run in a browser as shown in the
"Examples + Source Code" section of this post. The Visual representation offers
a controller through on screen buttons. The functionality of Animator can be
modified through the use of command line arguments.
## Creation
Animator was created over the course of about a month and a half starting on
November 2th and ending mid December.
