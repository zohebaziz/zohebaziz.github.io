## About My Website
This is my Personal Website that I created for the purpose of introducing myself
to anyone who come across this website and as a place where I can put my resume and
projects on display for anyone who may be interested in them. To check out any of my
projects, scroll down on this page and there will be blog posts about all that I
have uploaded so far. Clicking on the title of the project will allow you to see
all about the project including source code. To learn more about me
or take a look at my resume there are tabs in the upper right hand corner that will
take you to either of those pages. And finally, if you wish to contact me, I have
included some of my socials in my "About Me" page as well as a "Contact Me" page
that will send a message to my Email.
## Creation
This website was created using the Ruby Gem: Jekyll. Jekyll allowed me to
pick a pre created theme and easily start adding my own pages and posts through
files written in Markdown. In making some of these posts I had to learn some
basic HTML as Markdown accepts raw HTML code and features like creating lists or
uploading media to my webpages tended to work a lot better when I used HTML code
rather than Markdown commands. The last step was to host the site, GitHub Pages
ended up becoming my go to since all of the code was already up on GitHub and
Pages was easy to work with.
