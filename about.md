## Introduction
Hi! My name is Zoheb Aziz. I am second year Computer Science and Mathematics
major at Northeastern University. I was born in Long Island, New York and I
grew up in Grapevine, Texas.
## Hobbies, Interests and Activities
My main hobby revolves around watching and playing various sports. I love to
watch hockey and my favorite team is the Dallas Stars. Pre-covid I would often
go to the park and partake in pickup soccer and pickup volleyball games for
fun on weekends. I also enjoy weightlifting, I have been regularly going to the
gym for about a year now.\
A new interest I picked up recently is playing the piano. I have been teaching
myself to play since earlier last year and I have even got a few beginner
songs down. I spend a lot of my free time learning new classical and contemporary
songs on the keyboard in my room.
## Software Background
I have been a "STEM-minded" individual for as long as I can remember. I
especially enjoyed math and physics throughout my early high school years. As
a junior in high school I enrolled in an intro to computer science class as
one of my tech electives and I there realized what my true passion was. I
began learning JAVA as my first language and always had fun even programming
really basic projects we were assigned in that class. I felt like I got a type
of satisfaction from compiling code with no errors that constantly kept me
motivated and wanting more. It has now been 4 years since then and I know for
certain I made the right decision in pursuing a software degree, I have made
numerous programs since my first one as a high school junior and yet every time
I create a program that runs as intended I feel that same satisfaction I did when
I successfully ran my first program.
